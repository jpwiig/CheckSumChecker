# Filemesser/CheckSumChecker
### A simple program for all you messing with file integerity and hashing
[Current status: work in progress]

This will be a simple terminal program for hashing needs as well as checking the integerity of files with checksum. This is still a work in progress, but i decied to make this repository public since why not! 


### Current features that will be implemented: 
- [] hashing of strings
    - [x] md5 first phase 
    - [] possibility to change between the different hashing syncronous algorithmis that are supported 
- [] checksum of files
  - [] checking file integerity of simple binaries beeing giving a provided a path
  - [] not having the computer to absolute melt
  - [] some check against available malware lists -> certain that the file you are downloading are actually the thing that you are downloading
- other ideas
  - [] Somthing with asyncronous algorithms
  - [] pgp intgration (beeing able to create public keys and private keys that are supported on pgp servers)

If you have any tips about what is cool to have, let me know! I am open to suggestions!
